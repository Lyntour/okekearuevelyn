    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Evelyn, a graduate student of pure and applied chemistry currently working in the aviation industry as a passenger service executive. I'm an educationist and an advocate of quality education, leading me to volunteer for various educational programs. I am currently volunteering for Revolving City on a program called Freedom Group, aimed at educating school children with recorded videos of different subjects produced by a team of volunteer teachers. These videos are made using the school curriculum and visuals to aid understanding.</p>
    
    <p>My passion for writing has led me to take various courses and jobs in writing. Currently, I work with PCwritings as a guest writer and have taken a data science course with Vertebra Academy to advance my knowledge in technical analysis. I'm fulfilling my childhood dream in the health sector as a health educator specialized in telehealth, and I'm also a certified healthcare assistant.</p>

    <p>As an advocate of good health, I aim to further my education with a master's degree in public health and entomology. I am open to collaborations on tech advancements, writing, and innovation ideas about quality education. My passion to impact my community and society at large has driven me to organize various free webinars and events on technology advancements and health matters. I am currently building a community of great minds to learn together and become better versions of themselves. Send me a DM if you are interested!</p>
